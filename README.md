## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository contains the complete, production-ready source code examples found in **Volumes** of the **Web AI Series**.
 
---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run these examples, you need **Node.js (v18+)** installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-ai-vol1.git
cd web-ai-vol1
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
This project uses standard packages like `openai`, `zod`, `langchain`, and `dotenv`.
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Security is a major focus of this book. **Never hardcode your API keys.**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or inside specific chapter folders if running individually):

```bash
touch .env
```

Add your keys:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
# Optional for later chapters:
# SERPER_API_KEY=...
# PINECONE_API_KEY=...
```

### 4. Run an Example
Most scripts are designed to be run directly with `ts-node` for immediate feedback.

```bash
# Example: Running the basic Zod validation script
npx ts-node Book_01/Chapter_03_Type_Safe_AI/01_Basic_Examples/basic_zod_validation.ts
```
